DesignCENTERING scope of study to fully understand the scope of issues surrounding the central purpose proposes to

Qualitative: Ethnographic, interviews:
a. In the process of interviewing people thus far involved in the process it was learned that Mr. Melo has an additional need that he had not documented with us.  He often loses items and has been fortunate to have others return to him items of value.
b. We interviewed
                1) Conde'Nast subscribers
                2) Air B and B renters and rentees
                3) Air Canada Flight Attendents
                4) Trans-Pacific Partnership Members
                5) Haiti Relief Agency Volunteers
                6) Members of the Nairobi Alliance
                7) Dubai Berg Zavian Employees
                8) Employees of GE World Health of India

Our Quantitative Research consisted of:
1) Surveys- a) conducted with volunteers in a mall setting in rural Virginia, USA.
            b) on-line through a site called MyBestShow.com
            c) constant contact conducted a survey in South America regarding banking             processes
            testing, Analytics

DesignCENTERING performed an on-line audit/inventory of known competing systems. The entire team looked at Venmo and Apple Pay. We also looked at existing Banking Institutions both large, mid-size and small.

The details of this study and it's administration have been filed with encryption and you need the following code combined with your DC representative's responsive code to be opened. Your code is %5%6&99)000wowEEE. The following are brief overviews of the studies.
Venmo- has an unique social networking aspect that promised security to it's users. Users have to accept one another as members in order to receive or deliver commercial instruments in this case known as US Dollars. Venmo earns its money through the interest it earns on the money exchanged between it's members. The members earn no interest on their funds. There are minimal or no fees to the members.  Venmo's model only survives using the brick and mortar of existing banking institutions as the transfer vehicle. Threat or issue to Venmo is that if the person needing to pay or be paid is not a member there cannot be commerce.  Potential solution for this would be the addition of a service where the Venmo user could subscribe to a third party that provides wiring capabilities to existing institutions.

Apple Pay
Using an existing credit card company that has brick and mortar offices a user can tap an apple phone on a register and type in a code to have the apple account draft money from the existing credit cart. Advantages to this are that every time the card is swiped physically or charged a notice is sent to the owner of the said card. Disadvantages of this are that not all credit cards are created equal and some are more travel friendly than other=s.  One interviewee said that they wish they could just tap a map to show where they were traveling and not worry again about there banking needs.  Another interviewee said that they would like to have a service pay their bills or alert them that bills are ready to be paid.  Note this service already exists for some premium cards that charge a higher annual fee. The Apple business market seems to rely on the users continued dependence on the IOS platform.
